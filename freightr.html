                <h3>Initial Idea</h3>
                <p>The initial idea was to create a shipping tracking management software for delivery
                    companies to manage their shipments. We had to get our idea approved by the professor
                    as it was course project and we were required to do so. Our idea got approved and then we started 
                    working to bring this idea to life.
                </p>

                <h3>Procedure</h3>
                <p>
                    We set up the repository on GitHub and started working on the initial static GUI for the project.
                    We had this idea to make this a Login based kind of system where employees had to login to their systems
                    and we did its GUI first. I mainly worked on the backend of this project. I did the whole backend for the 
                    DB setup form where companies had to configure their databases. I wrote CRUD operations for different tables.
                    I connected the backend to the front end. We decided to make it a functional application first and then touch its 
                    front end for designing. Kohinoor and I basically took care of the whole backend department and designed the databases
                    and the application layout and any other features. Anshul mostly took care of the front end and its designing. We faced a lot of issues during the development face and we managed to overcome all of it.
                    I was very satisfied with the end level product we got.

                <h3>Tech Used</h3>
                <p>In developing Freightr, we utilized <b>GitHub</b> for version control and collaboration, <b>MySQL server</b> for backend, <b>JavaFX</b> for the frontend, and <b>IntelliJ IDEA</b> as our integrated development environment (IDE). GitHub facilitated code sharing and collaboration, JavaFX enabled us to create a visually appealing user interface, and IntelliJ IDEA streamlined our development process with its robust features and seamless integration with JavaFX and Git. This combination of tools allowed us to efficiently develop and deliver a polished Shipping Management Software.</p>
