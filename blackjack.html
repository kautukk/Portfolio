                <h3>Initial Game</h3>
                <p>Our journey into the realm of Blackjack began with a spark of inspiration and the collaborative efforts of our team. Assigned as a group project, myself, Nolan, and Aarav embarked on a mission to bring the excitement of this classic card game to life in the form of a dynamic and engaging application.

                    Our initial idea revolved around creating an immersive Blackjack experience that would capture the essence of a real casino, right on the screens of our users' devices. We envisioned sleek design, seamless gameplay, and an intuitive interface that would appeal to both seasoned players and newcomers alike.
                    
                    As we delved into the project, we brainstormed ideas, sketched out concepts, and discussed various features and functionalities that we wanted to incorporate. From the mechanics of the game to the user experience and visual design, every aspect was carefully considered to ensure an authentic and enjoyable experience for our users.
                    
                    After countless hours of planning and collaboration, we presented our initial idea to our professor, eager to showcase our vision for the Blackjack app. With enthusiasm and determination, we embarked on this journey, fueled by our passion for technology and our shared love for the thrill of the cards.</p>

                <h3>Procedure</h3>
                <p>Our project began with setting up the repository on GitHub, where we established a collaborative environment to work on our blackjack game. Nolan took the lead in laying down the foundational code, establishing the basic structure and framework for the game. He ensured that the project was set up properly, with clear organization and structure to facilitate teamwork.

                    As the project progressed, I focused on the backend development, designing the algorithm for the game logic. This involved implementing the rules of blackjack, handling player actions such as hitting, standing, and doubling down, and managing the flow of the game. I worked closely with Nolan to integrate my backend logic seamlessly with the existing codebase, ensuring a cohesive and functional gameplay experience.
                    
                    Meanwhile, Aarav took charge of the frontend development, bringing the game to life with engaging visuals and user interface elements. He designed and implemented the game interface, including the game board, cards, and user controls. Aarav's expertise in frontend development was instrumental in creating an intuitive and visually appealing gaming experience for players.
                    
                    In addition to the core gameplay features, our blackjack game also involved additional elements such as music and score tracking for players. We collaborated to integrate these features into the game, enhancing the overall experience and adding depth to the gameplay. Nolan handled the implementation of music playback, while Aarav and I worked together to implement the score tracking functionality.
                    
                    Overall, our collaborative efforts and division of tasks allowed us to successfully develop and launch our blackjack game. By leveraging each team member's strengths and expertise, we were able to create a polished and enjoyable gaming experience for players, complete with engaging visuals, immersive music, and robust gameplay mechanics.</p>

                <h3>Tech Used</h3>
                <p>In developing our Blackjack game, we utilized <b>GitHub</b> for version control and collaboration, <b>JavaFX</b> for the frontend, and <b>IntelliJ IDEA</b> as our integrated development environment (IDE). GitHub facilitated code sharing and collaboration, JavaFX enabled us to create a visually appealing user interface, and IntelliJ IDEA streamlined our development process with its robust features and seamless integration with JavaFX and Git. This combination of tools allowed us to efficiently develop and deliver a polished Blackjack game.</p>
