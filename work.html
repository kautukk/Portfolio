                <h3>Assistant Soccer Coach</h3>
                <b>JULY 2022 - JULY 2023</b>
                <p class="scoach">I had the privilege of serving as the <b>Assistant Soccer Coach</b> for the junior team at <b>The Rare Fighters FC</b>, a role that allowed me to combine my passion for soccer with my desire to mentor young athletes. As a former player for the club, I cherished the opportunity to give back to the community that had shaped me as both a player and a person.

                    During my time as Assistant Coach, I collaborated closely with the <b>Mr. Hardeep Singh Saini</b> to develop training programs aimed at enhancing players' skills, tactical understanding, and overall fitness. Providing constructive feedback and guidance to players was a key aspect of my role, as I sought to support their growth and development both on and off the field.
                    
                    Beyond coaching, I viewed my role as a mentor and role model for the players, emphasizing the importance of sportsmanship, teamwork, and perseverance. I took pride in helping young athletes navigate the challenges of competitive sports while instilling values that would serve them well in all aspects of their lives.
                    
                    Though my time as Assistant Soccer Coach has come to an end, the experience has left a lasting impact on me. I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of the The Rare Fighters FC community and to have contributed to the development of its young athletes. While I may not currently be in this role, my passion for soccer and for empowering others continues to drive me forward in all that I do.</p>
