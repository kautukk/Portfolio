                <h3>Initial Idea</h3>
                <p>The Yatzy project unfolded across three distinct phases, primarily emphasizing database management and web development. Initially, we laid the groundwork by structuring the database schema to efficiently store user information and Yatzy scores. Next, we delved into implementing the website's core functionalities, enabling users to submit their Yatzy scores through user-friendly interfaces. In the final phase, we focused on refining the user experience and adding administrative capabilities, ensuring the website's seamless operation. By project completion, we had crafted a fully operational website, empowering users to interact with Yatzy scores effortlessly.</p>

                <h3>Procedure</h3>
                <p>Our journey with the Yatzy project unfolded in three distinct phases, each adding new layers of functionality and complexity to our web application.

                    In the initial phase, we focused on creating a basic web app for updating scores. Users could input their Yatzy scores through a simple form, and the scores would be updated in the database accordingly. This phase served as our foundation, allowing us to familiarize ourselves with the database structure and basic web development concepts.
                    
                    As we progressed to the second phase, our focus shifted towards enhancing user experience and adding more advanced features. We introduced the capability for users to upload files, such as screenshots of their Yatzy scores, alongside their score submissions. However, we encountered challenges regarding file sizes, as larger files posed potential issues for storage and processing. Addressing these challenges required us to implement file size limitations and optimize file handling processes.
                    
                    In the final phase of development, we added an administrative login page to our web application. This login page provided access for administrators to manage user scores. Admins could log in securely, gaining access to a dashboard where they could review, approve, or remove user scores as needed. This addition added a layer of control and accountability to our application, ensuring that only authorized individuals could manage the Yatzy scores.
                    
                    By the end of our journey, we had transformed our initial basic score updating web app into a comprehensive Yatzy scoring platform. Through iterative development and collaboration, we successfully navigated through various challenges and complexities, culminating in a robust and feature-rich web application that catered to the needs of both users and administrators alike.</p>

                <h3>Tech Used</h3>
                <p>In creating our Yatzy application, we utilized <B>PHP</B> for server-side scripting and <b>MySQL</b> for database management. PHP enabled us to handle user interactions, process data, and generate dynamic content, while MySQL provided a reliable platform for storing and retrieving game-related information. Additionally, <b>FileZilla</b> was instrumental in uploading files to our web server, facilitating the seamless integration of user-submitted screenshots and other assets into our application.</p>
